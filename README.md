# Image-Caption-Generator
This project implements an image caption generator using deep neural network models. Image captioning is a crucial task in computer vision, where the goal is to generate a textual description that accurately represents the content of an image. This task involves recognizing significant objects, their features, and the relationships between them within the image, ultimately generating semantically and syntactically correct phrases. The primary objectives include:
  - 1. Object Recognition: Recognizing various objects present in an image.
  - 2. Relationship Analysis: Analyzing the relationships between objects within the image.
   - 3. Caption Generation: Generating descriptive captions accurately representing the image's content.
