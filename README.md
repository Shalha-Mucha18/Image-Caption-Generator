# Image-Caption-Generator
This is my project which belongs to the course ETE 300. I have completed the report for this project which is included in the repository.
Implemented a multimodal approach for generating accurate textual descriptions or captions for given
images. Developed a system that produces captions closely aligned with the actual context of the images,
showcasing proficiency in image understanding and natural language processing
